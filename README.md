CKTL

This is an application I wrote with a partner for module 1 of the Flatiron School, made for determining what cocktail a user might be able to make, or almost make (if they're missing an ingredient), given the ingredients they currently have available. Additional features include the ability to view a cocktail's recipe, search for an existing cocktail out of the 350+ cocktails available, view all cocktails, be surprised by a random cocktail, save and view favorites, as well as the ability to add, edit, and keep track of the ingredients on your "shelf". Additionally, one can log in and out, and the changes you've made to your account will be saved.

This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application, meaning this will run completely within your command line/terminal. Simply clone down the app, make your way into the newly cloned directory, and type in the command "ruby bin/run.rb" to get started.

Use the arrow keys and the enter key to navigate.
